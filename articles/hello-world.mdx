It is my pleasure to present the first article of my blog and the very first I ever wrote. To be
fair, this one is just for practice and to learn some tools I need (e.g Markdown) while I'm
creating this place on the internet for myself. Think about it as a prop to other articles I'll
create. I hope the next ones will be more helpful and creative.

## [What I'd like to achieve with this project](#what-i-would-like-to-achieve-with-this-project)

<div aria-hidden="true" id="what-i-would-like-to-achieve-with-this-project">

Just for you to know, my goal with this blog, I have to be honest, is to learn and practice some
skills that I feel I could be better at. Why am I saying that? One of the things that I like the
most is to read. There's something about sitting down on a chair, grab a book and have the
opportunity to learn about a subject I'm interested in or to be taken to another world (the feeling
that I had when I was reading _Harry Potter_, _The Chronicles of Arthur_ and even the _Autobiography
of Benjamin Franklin_).

Because of that I always admired people that can put their thoughts down on the paper and express
themselves in a way that others could understand. Write and give them the chance to learn? That's
amazing and to be able to do that you have to have the ability to speak clearly, to think in a
organized way, to have patience and also to have the knowledge about the subject you want to talk
about, even if you're talking about yourself. That's what I think.

## [Get to the point, what you will get in this blog](#get-to-the-point-what-you-will-get-in-this-blog)

<div aria-hidden="true" id="what-i-would-like-to-achieve-with-this-project">

In this blog the main subject you'll find is about **software development**, but I would also like to
talk about things I'm doing in a daily basis, the books I'm reading and what I'm learning with them,
projects that I am participating, tools that I use to be more productive, etc. I hope I'm able to help you
with something and create value in your life the same way you're creating value in mine as you read this.
I'm grateful you made it this far, see you soon and be great!
