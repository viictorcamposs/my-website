A few days ago, I was working on my first [project][myGithubProject] that involved fetching data from
an external API for my app. Since this is a fundamental task in software development, I thought about
writing this tutorial on how to make a simple network request using the URLSession object and maybe
**help someone in the future**. So, join me, and let's work together!

### URLSession

URLSession is a powerful API provided by Swift for handling network tasks, such as fetching data
for our app, downloading files, and uploading data and files to remote locations. As you can see,
we can do a lot of things with it, but don't worry, for now, we'll keep it simple.

Let's use the project I mentioned as an example. We're building an app that'll show the latest
Bitcoin prices in different currencies. To make it happen, we'll use the URLSession to grab the data
from the [CoinAPI][CoinAPI] following four simple steps:

- **Step 1:** Create a URL
- **Step 2:** Create a URLSession
- **Step 3:** Give URLSession a task
- **Step 4:** Start the task

  If you're not currently working on a project, you can create a **playground** blank file in Xcode
  to follow along with this tutorial. Just make sure you import the _Foundation_ framework.

### Setting Up

#### Step 1: Create a URL

The [URL structure][urlStructure] identifies the location of the resource we want to access. When
creating an instance of this structure, you'll notice that the same method can be called with different
parameters. In our case, we'll initialize it using only the _string_ param.

```swift showLineNumbers /URL(string: urlString)/
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {

}
```

- Because URL() has an optional type, we use the [optional binding][optionalBinding] concept with
  the **if let statement** to safely unwrap and access the value returned from the URL instance

#### Step 2: Create a URLSession

In the next step we create and configure a session for our network request.

```swift showLineNumbers {5}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
}
```

There are three types of URL sessions that we can use:

- [**Default:**][urlDefaultSession] used for basic requests and suitable for most common use cases
- [**Ephemeral:**][urlEphemeralSession] similar to the default config, but it doesn't store any data.
  For example, you can use this config when requesting user credentials for your app
- [**Background:**][urlBackgroundSession] allows you to download or upload data in the background, like
  when you suspend an app on your iOS device

### Making GET Request

#### Step 3: Give URLSession a task

Now that we have our URLSession set up and ready to go, it's time to assign a task to it. URLSession
supports three key types of tasks:

- **Data tasks:** send and receive data; intended for short, often interactive requests
- **Download tasks:** for scenarios where you want to download large files, and save them to the device's storage
- **Upload tasks:** typically used in scenarios like sending user-generated content or files to a server

These are the most commonly used tasks. We also have WebSocket and Stream tasks, but they're used in
more advanced scenarios, so for now, I won't talk about them.

**Implementing a data task for our session:**

```swift showLineNumbers {7-9}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)

  let task = session.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in

  }
}
```

- We use the _dataTask(with: URL, completionHandler:)_ method, implementing the _completionHandler:_
  function with a [closure][swiftClosure]

#### Step 4: Start the task

The task we added to our session initially has a suspended state, which means that it's waiting
for us to start it. We do this by calling its _resume()_ method.

```swift showLineNumbers {11}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)

  let task = session.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in

  }

  task.resume()
}
```

And, once we've done starting the task, we're able to continue and handle the response.

### Handling response

When we print the data returned from the _dataTask()_ method, it'll not be possible for us to see
its content.

```swift showLineNumbers {11-12}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)

  let task = session.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    // data has an optional type: Data?
    // again, we use optional binding to unwrap it
    if let safeData = data {
      print("raw data: ", safeData)
      // raw data: 138 bytes
    }
  }

  task.resume()
}
```

Although we know the data is in JSON format (based on our API's documentation), that's not exactly
what we got. So, what should we do?

#### Parsing data in JSON format

{/* We need to format this raw data, and then we'll be able to read and use it. */}
To fix this, we need to parse the data and turn it into an actual Swift object with properties and methods.

**Create a Struct with the expected JSON properties**

```swift showLineNumbers /Decodable/
struct CoinData: Decodable {
  let rate: Double
  let asset_id_quote: String
}
```

- We use the _Decodable_ protocol to let Swift know that our struct can decode itself from an external
  representation. This means that we can easily read data in JSON format and convert it into our Swift struct

**Parse JSON with the native JSONDecoder**

```swift showLineNumbers {9-18}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)

  let task = session.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let safeData = data {
      do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()

        let decodedData = try decoder.decode(
          CoinData.self, // reference the type object
          from: safeData
        )
      } catch {
        print(error)
      }
    }
  }

  task.resume()
}
```

- the _decode_ method (11) can **throw an error**, so we need to add the _try_ word
- because we're using the _try_ word, we need to wrap it inside a **do block**
- then, we add the **catch block** to handle any potential errors properly

**Access properties from API JSON response**

Now, if we try to access the _decodedData_ constant, we'll be able to get the _rate_ and _asset_id_quote_
properties we extracted from the API JSON response.

```swift showLineNumbers {17-21}
let urlString =
  "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/exchangerate/BTC/BRL?apikey=YOUR-API-KEY"

if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
  let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)

  let task = session.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
    if let safeData = data {
      do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()

        let decodedData = try decoder.decode(
          CoinData.self, // reference the type object
          from: safeData
        )

        print(decodedData)
        // CoinData(
        //  rate: 140113.1208321098,
        //  asset_id_quote: "BRL"
        // )
      } catch {
        print(error)
      }
    }
  }

  task.resume()
}
```
