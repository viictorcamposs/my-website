{/* What is the purpose of the article? */}
{/* Who is the target audience? */}
The purpose is for a beginner in Swift programming language to be able to understand the initial
concept of developing with classes and structures and to know how and when to use one or the other;
to know what is essential to understand about classes and structures when developing in Swift.
{/* Why is it essential for beginners to understand classes and structures in Swift? */}
Write better code in Swift programming language and become a better engineer (or developer).
Michael Jordan onde said: "Once you've got the fundamentals down, you've got a solid foundation
to build on." That's the purpose of the article, understand and work the fundamentals, and build
the foundation to code great applications.
