When we begin to study Swift, we come across structures and classes, and at first, it might be a
little hard to understand them because they are very similar to one another and they can do pretty
much the same thing. But if you head to Apple's documentation, is recommended to prefer using
structures instead of classes. Why is that?

In this article I'd like to answer this question, explain what I've learned are the main
differences between classes and structures and how to choose which one to use.

{/* </ArticleNote> */}

### Overview

In Swift, both classes and structs are like a blueprint for creating objects or types. Whenever you
want to define a new type of something, we use classes or structures to do it. Let's put this into
code by creating a developer type.

As I've said, and I know I'm being repetitive about this, they are very similar. So both of them can
define properties to store value and methods to provide functionality. They have a lot more in common,
but let's stick with the basics here.

```swift showLineNumbers
class Developer {
	var cProperty: String

	func cMethod() {}
}

struct Developer {
	var sProperty: String

	func sMethod() {}
}
```

- Whenever you create a class or structure, you're defining a new Swift type. As every Swift type,
  we use _UpperCamelCase_ names to match Swift standards.

**Creating new instances**

One of the things that differentiates structures from classes is that, unlike classes, we don't
have to write the _initializer_ for the structure properties. We could just create a new instance
passing its initial values.

```swift showLineNumbers {7}
struct Developer {
	var sProperty: String

	func sMethod() {}
}

var newStruct = Developer(sProperty: "value")
```

For classes, we have to write the initializer.

```swift showLineNumbers {4-6}
class Developer {
	var cProperty: String

	init(cProperty: String) {
		self.cProperty = cProperty
	}

	func sMethod() {}
}

var newClass = Developer(cProperty: "value")
```

That's an easy difference to understand and you don't have to worry about it too much, Xcode
will always give you an error whenever you forget to write the initializer for your classes.

Let's get on with more advanced concepts and differences between structs and classes.

### Key Differences

Now, we know that both classes and structs are used to create types and objects. The next question
you probably have in mind is when should we use one or the other. To answer this question we need
to understand what are the key differences between them.

#### Reference vs Value types

The main difference between a class and a structure is that a struct is a value type, and that
means that it's copied whenever it's used. While the class is a reference type. Let's break this
down.

Imagine we're working on a presentation together and we've got a template that we're using to create
this presentation. We'll represent this template in our code using a struct.

```swift showLineNumbers
struct PresentationTemplate {
	var numberOfSlides: Int
}
```

Then, I give you one copy of the template and I have one copy as well.

```swift showLineNumbers
var template = PresentationTemplate(numberOfSlides: 4)

var myTemplate = template
var yourTemplate = template
```

Because we're using a struct, no matter what change you make on your template, it won't affect the
copy I have.

```swift showLineNumbers
yourTemplate.numberOfSlides += 2

print(yourTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
print(myTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 4
```

Now, if we were working with classes, because classes are a reference type, every single thing that
you do on your template will affect mine too, they are the same one.

```swift showLineNumbers /class/ {4-6, 16-17}
class PresentationTemplate {
    var numberOfSlides: Int

    init(numberOfSlides: Int) {
        self.numberOfSlides = numberOfSlides
    }
}

var template = PresentationTemplate(numberOfSlides: 4)

var myTemplate = template
var yourTemplate = template

yourTemplate.numberOfSlides += 2

print(yourTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
print(myTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
```

#### Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental behavior that differentiates classes from structures. Basically,
a class can _inherit_ methods and properties from another class.

Let's create a class called _Developer_ and add some properties and methods for it.

```swift showLineNumbers
class Developer {
	var skills = ["Write code"]

	func introduce() {
		print("I'm a software engineer and I can write code.")
	}
}
```

- Because the _skills_ property already has a value, we don't need to write an initializer function
  for our class.

Then, we will create a class called _TechLead_. This class will have everything that our class
_Developer_ has by inheriting from it, and we can check this by accessing a method or property
from the _Developer_ class.

```swift showLineNumbers
class TechLead: Developer {}

TechLead().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."
```

- In this case, TechLead is a _subclass_ of the _superclass_ Developer.

Not only a subclass can inherit from the superclass, but can also override its properties and methods.

```swift showLineNumbers
class Developer {
	var skills = ["Write code"]

	func introduce() {
		print("I'm a software engineer and I can write code.")
	}
}

class TechLead: Developer {
	override func introduce() {
		super.introduce()
		print("Also, I lead a team of developers.")
	}
}

Developer().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."

TechLead().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."
// "Also, I lead a team of developers."
```

### Which one to use

As I've mentioned, Apple's documentation tells us to prefer using structures, rather than classes.
In Swift, structures include many features that are limited to classes in other languages. On top
of that, structs are simpler to use, they're faster, we have less memory leaks, etc.

So if you have doubt in which one to use, go with struct by default and change to class if you
realize you need the features that only classes provide you, like inheritance.

### Conclusion

Michael Jordan onde said: _"Once you've got the fundamentals down, you've got a solid foundation
to build on."_ That's the purpose of this article, help you work the fundamentals and start building
the foundation for coding great applications.

But let's be honest here, this is far from being enough. As seen in the last section,
there's a lot more for you (for me as well) to study and understand about structures and classes
in Swift. Why there's less memory leaks using structs? Why are they faster?

These are questions that by design weren't covered in here but they're great next steps for us to
follow. So I will do my part from here and I trully hope that you do yours from there.
Great work, and see you next time! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
