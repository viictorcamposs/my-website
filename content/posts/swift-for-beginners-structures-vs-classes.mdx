As a beginner in Swift, structures and classes might be a little hard to understand because they are
very similar to one another and they can do pretty much the same thing. In this article I'd like
to give you a brief explanation of what I've learned are the main differences between classes and
structures and how to choose which one to use.

{/* <ArticleNote> */}
{/* If you're just a beginner in Swift and not in programming in general, you may already know what */}
{/* classes and structures are. Still, I think it's important for you to read this article. But you */}
{/* can jump to the _key differences_ section. */}
{/* </ArticleNote> */}

### Overview

In Swift, classes and structs are like a blueprint for creating objects or types. As I've said,
they are very similar, and both of them can define properties to store value and methods to provide
functionality.

[They have a lot more in common][classandstructures], but let's stick with the basics here and put
this into code by creating a developer type.

```swift showLineNumbers
class Developer {
	var cProperty: String

	func cMethod() {}
}

struct Developer {
	var sProperty: String

	func sMethod() {}
}
```

- Whenever you create a class or structure, you're defining a new Swift type. As every Swift type,
  we use _UpperCamelCase_ naming to match Swift standards.

**Creating new instances**

One of the things that differentiates structures from classes is that, unlike classes, we don't
have to write the _initializer_ for the structure properties. We could just create a new instance
passing its initial values.

```swift showLineNumbers {7}
struct Developer {
	var sProperty: String

	func sMethod() {}
}

var newStruct = Developer(sProperty: "value")
```

For classes, we have to write the initializer.

```swift showLineNumbers {4-6}
class Developer {
	var cProperty: String

	init(cProperty: String) {
		self.cProperty = cProperty
	}

	func sMethod() {}
}

var newClass = Developer(cProperty: "value")
```

That's an easy difference to understand and you don't have to worry about it too much, Xcode
will always give you an error whenever you forget to write the initializer for your classes.

Let's get on with more advanced concepts and differences between structs and classes.

### Key Differences

Now, we know that both classes and structs are used to create types and objects. The next question
you probably have in mind is when should we use one or the other. To answer this question we need
to understand what are the key differences between them.

#### Reference vs Value types

The main difference between a class and a structure is that a struct is a value type, and that
means that it's copied whenever it's used. While the class is a reference type. Let's break this
down.

Imagine we're working on a presentation together and we've got a template that we're using to create
this presentation. We'll represent this template in our code using a struct.

```swift showLineNumbers
struct PresentationTemplate {
	var numberOfSlides: Int
}
```

Then, I give you one copy of the template and I have one copy as well.

```swift showLineNumbers
var template = PresentationTemplate(numberOfSlides: 4)

var myTemplate = template
var yourTemplate = template
```

Because we're using a struct, no matter what change you make on your template, it won't affect the
copy I have.

```swift showLineNumbers
yourTemplate.numberOfSlides += 2

print(yourTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
print(myTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 4
```

Now, if we were working with classes, because classes are a reference type, every single thing that
you do on your template will affect mine too, they are the same one.

```swift showLineNumbers /class/ {4-6, 16-17}
class PresentationTemplate {
    var numberOfSlides: Int

    init(numberOfSlides: Int) {
        self.numberOfSlides = numberOfSlides
    }
}

var template = PresentationTemplate(numberOfSlides: 4)

var myTemplate = template
var yourTemplate = template

yourTemplate.numberOfSlides += 2

print(yourTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
print(myTemplate.numberOfSlides) // 6
```

#### Inheritance

[Inheritance][inheritance] is a fundamental behavior that differentiates classes from structures.
Basically, a class can _inherit_ methods and properties from another class.

Let's create a class called _Developer_ and add some properties and methods for it.

```swift showLineNumbers
class Developer {
	var skills = ["Write code"]

	func introduce() {
		print("I'm a software engineer and I can write code.")
	}
}
```

- Because the _skills_ property already has a value, we don't need to write an initializer function
  for our class.

Then, we will create a class called _TechLead_. This class will have everything that our class
_Developer_ has by inheriting from it, and we can check this by accessing a method or property
from the _Developer_ class.

```swift showLineNumbers /Developer/ {3-4}
class TechLead: Developer {}

TechLead().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."
```

- In this case, TechLead is a _subclass_ of the _superclass_ Developer.

Not only a subclass can inherit from the superclass, but also provide its own custom implementation
for the inherited methods and properties. This is known as _overriding_.

```swift showLineNumbers {10-13}
class Developer {
	var skills = ["Write code"]

	func introduce() {
		print("I'm a software engineer and I can write code.")
	}
}

class TechLead: Developer {
	override func introduce() {
		super.introduce()
		print("Also, I lead a team of developers.")
	}
}

Developer().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."

TechLead().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."
// "Also, I lead a team of developers."
```

In this case, we've used the existing superclass implementation as part of our override. But we
could've totally changed the behavior of the method by removing _super.introduce()_ from our
function.

```swift showLineNumbers {10-11}
class TechLead: Developer {
	override func introduce() {
		print("I'm a Tech Leader and I manage a team of developers")
	}
}

Developer().introduce()
// "I'm a software engineer and I can write code."

TechLead().introduce()
// "I'm a Tech Leader and I manage a team of developers"
```

### Which one to use

If you check Swift doc, [Apple recommends using structures over classes][structsbydefault].
On top of the fact that structs include many features limited to classes in other languages,
they're also simpler to use, faster, and result in less memory leaks.

So, whenever you have doubt about which one to use, go with struct and consider switching to a
class if you realize that you need features only classes can provide, like inheritance.

### Conclusion

Michael Jordan onde said: _"Get the fundamentals down and the level of everything you do will rise."
_ That's the purpose of this article: to help you work the fundamentals and start building the
foundation for coding great applications.

But this is far away from being enough. As seen in the last section, there's a lot more for you
(and for me as well) to explore and understand about structures and classes in Swift. Why do
structs result in fewer memory leaks? Why are they faster?

These are questions that, by design, weren't covered in here but they're great next steps for us to
explore. So I'll do my part from here and I truly hope that you'll do yours from there.
Great work, and see you next time! üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
