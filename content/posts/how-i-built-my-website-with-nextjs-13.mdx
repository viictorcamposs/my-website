Since I started my journey as a software developer, writing articles is something that I've always
wanted to do. Almost 3 years on the road, I realized the time was passing and I was losing the opportunity
to use a great tool for my development. So, I finally decided to create my own website and start blogging.

Building it from scratch was about having complete control and learning cool new stuff like Tailwind,
Contentlayer, MDX, and more. Now I have my own space where I can experiment with techs I don't get to use
at work and improve my learning skills by writing articles about the subjects I'm studying.

Stay with me, I'd like to share with you how I built it, the tech choices I made, decisions, mistakes
and next steps for it.

### Tech Stack

#### Next.js

[Next.js][next] is a framework for building web applications using React components.

I've already used it to build other projects so I knew exactly the developer experience I was
going to have and knew that it provides me with great features to work the performance and
user experience of my website.

This first version was the perfect opportunity to get my hands dirty with the new concepts and
features the Vercel team introduced:

- Integration with React server components
- Entire new project structure and file-system based router
- Font optimization, etc.

Although they don't recommend to use the new version in production, I'm doing it to
know first hand how it's working and to learn and apply advanced front-end concepts.

#### TypeScript

[TypeScript][typescript] is a highly typed language built on top of JavaScript and basically
ensures me in the editor that what I'm writing is working without the need to run and get the
error on the browser.

My code gets a bit more extense and it takes more time to write, but using TypeScript brings
me several benefits that justify this "time loss":

- Speed up the process of finding errors like typos and other common mistakes
- Great integration and intelligent code completion feature with VS Code
- Improved my level of perception of what I'm writing as I started to better analyze and
  organize the code.

#### Tailwind

[Tailwind][tailwind] is an utility-first CSS framework that helps me build user interfaces using
predefined classes. I have used it a few times and knew that it could speed up my development
process if I got more practice.

Also, it's great [integration with VS Code][tailwind/intellisense], well organized documentation and
straightforward way to start using with Next.js made easy to choose Tailwind as my styling tool.

#### MDX

MDX is a JavaScript library that allows me to create markdown content with JSX components.

So far, its been a great development experience. Easy to start using it with Next.js, great
support from the community with enough guides and examples and the possibilities of use seems
to be limited by my imagination.

Also, it's worth mention that its integration with [Contentlayer][contentlayer] made pretty easy
to use MDX with Next.js 13 and React server components.

#### Framer Motion

[Framer Motion][framermotion] is a simple yet powerful animation library for React.

Honestly, animation was never the focus when studying front-end concepts. I don't have much
knowledge or experience but with Framer Motion was easy to start implement some animation
on my website.

The idea to use Framer Motion came from [Zeno Rocha's website][zenorocha], but there are other
reasons of why I continued to use:

- _**Documentation**_ - well organized and full of great examples
- _**Developer Experience**_ - easy to start using and great features available

#### Vercel

[Vercel][vercel] is a deployment and collaboration platform for front-end developers.

It has the best support for Next.js available out there and other reasons of why I chose Vercel are:

- Full infrastructure available to deploy with just a few steps
- Automatic CI/CD with [GitHub's integration][github/vercel]
- Free plan to work with personal projects

By using Vercel I'm free to focus on the development of my website and let them handle in the best
way the complexities that comes with deploying a front-end project.

### Design

My main focus when thinking about the website design was _**simplicity**_. I wanted it to be
minimalist, feature focused and to have space to add new ideas in the future.

Working with design isn't one of my best skills. So, I started to search for good references
on the internet and used them to create a prototype in [Figma][figma].

In the end, 2 websites were used for inspirations:

- Color scheme and animations were inspired by [Zeno Rocha's website][zenorocha]
- Elements and content structure were inspired by [Delba Oliveira's website][delbaoliveira]

### Content

Initially, my content is focused on developers and tech recruiters. This is the place
where I have the freedom to show my skills, share my knowledge and experience and also have the
opportunity to improve my learning skill.

### Lessons

I think it's important to discuss the main lesson I learned from this project. Leave it registered
here for future reference. Maybe also help others to avoid making the same mistake.

#### Planning

I have no doubt that a big part of the mistakes I made could have been avoided by investing more
time in planning and giving more attention to details. Sometimes I let other reasons
a part from my goals with the project be the X factor when deciding something.

**#1 Start a course about testing and use the project as a playground for practice**

Testing was something that I had wanted to learn for a long time. Although using the project
to learn about it had its benefits and the result was that I did learn a new concept and gained
experience in writing unit and integration tests with Jest and Testing-library, starting a new
course while working on it was bad decision.

Along the way, the difficulties we all face when learning something started to come. Using
my project goals as a guide for decision-making, the time I invested in overcoming those
difficulties could've been better used improving the user experience, adding other features,
or completing the project sooner. In the end, most of the tests I wrote went to the trash
(_another mistake, shouldn't have done that hehe_).

**#2 Use Prismic to manage content instead of MDX + Contentlayer**

Using Prismic as my content management system was also about learning a new concept - _Headless
CMS_. It's an interesting tool to learn and I could see the benefits of using something alike to
improve the work between the development and the marketing teams.

But, again, what needs do I have to consider when thinking about the goals I had with the project?
I need to ensure a good writing experience for the articles and great performance for the user
experience.

For a project with a single person handling development and writing the articles? [MDX + Contentlayer][mdx/contentlayer]
is a better solution. It's more developer-friendly and offers better performance by loading
the content statically stored within the project.

### Next Steps

I don't know about you, but as I developed the project, new ideas would always come and scream
inside my head, boosting my drive to continue to add features and other improvements.

The truth is that if I continued to work on the project, I'd always find things to change and
would never be satisfied with the result. But that's the beauty. This website is something I don't want
to be fully satisfied with. Everytime I look at it, I want to spot something to improve,
a new idea to try, a new way to work on the user experience.

Hopefully, I will be able to do that, but for now, I'm happy with how it is and what I really want
to work on is improving my ability to write articles and share with the world the things I'm learning
as a software developer.
